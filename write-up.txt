Phenomena #1: Determiners

According to Chelliah's A grammar of Meithei(2011), Meitei has two types of determiners, -si 'proximate' PDET and -tu 'distal' DDET. PDET indicates that "the object or person being spoken of is near or currently seen or known to be near, even if not viewable by the speaker, or is currently the topic of conversation"; DDET "signifies something or someone not present at the time of speech or newly introduced in the conversation. (p.81)"

Before improvements, there are three determiners defined in our choice file:
  det1_name=det1
    det1_stem1_orth=púm-nə-mək
    det1_stem1_pred=_exist_q_rel
    det1_feat1_name=case
    det1_feat1_value=all
  det2_name=det2
    det2_stem1_orth=bie=ki
    det2_stem1_pred=_exist_q_rel
  det3_name=det3
    det3_stem1_orth=ná
    det3_stem1_pred=_exist_q_rel

However, after looking up these determiner stems, I found they are enclitic other than determiners. púm means 'all', nə means 'each', 'mək' means 'only.' But they do not function as 'all,' 'only,' or 'each' in determiners in English. For example, 'all -forget forget -NOM' means 'to forget completely.'

=ki is a genitive case marker, ná can be a agent case marker or a contrastive pragmatic peak. 

Therefore, after cleaning det1-3 and adding correct determiners, we have:  det5_name=det5-distance-det
    det5_stem1_orth=tú
    det5_stem1_pred=_ddet_q_rel
  det6_name=det6-proximate-det
    det6_stem1_orth=čhí
    det6_stem1_pred=_pdet_q_rel

We added test cases #19 to #22 to test determiners. #19 is a grammatical sentence with PDET, #20 grammatical with DDET, #21 ungrammatical with PDET and #22 ungrammatical with DDET.

#19 and #20 were parsed successfully after improvements. However, we observed it treated "man PDET cry-ASRT" as "V D N." We observed our choice file had multiple lexical entries for "man" and "cry," they are both in noun and verb categories at the same time. So we cleaned that up (removed _man_v_rel and _cry_n_rel), and changed "noun-det-order=det-noun" to "noun-det." Therefore, #21 and #22 are correctly ruled out because there's no rule for "D V" to form a constituent.
