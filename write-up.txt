Phenomena #1: Determiners

According to Chelliah's A grammar of Meithei(2011), Meitei has two types of determiners, -si 'proximate' PDET and -tu 'distal' DDET. PDET indicates that "the object or person being spoken of is near or currently seen or known to be near, even if not viewable by the speaker, or is currently the topic of conversation"; DDET "signifies something or someone not present at the time of speech or newly introduced in the conversation. (p.81)"

Before improvements, there are three determiners defined in our choice file:
  det1_name=det1
    det1_stem1_orth=púm-nə-mək
    det1_stem1_pred=_exist_q_rel
    det1_feat1_name=case
    det1_feat1_value=all
  det2_name=det2
    det2_stem1_orth=bie=ki
    det2_stem1_pred=_exist_q_rel
  det3_name=det3
    det3_stem1_orth=ná
    det3_stem1_pred=_exist_q_rel

However, after looking up these determiner stems, I found they are enclitic other than determiners. púm means 'all', nə means 'each', 'mək' means 'only.' But they do not function as 'all,' 'only,' or 'each' in determiners in English. For example, 'all -forget forget -NOM' means 'to forget completely.'

=ki is a genitive case marker, ná can be a agent case marker or a contrastive pragmatic peak.

Therefore, after cleaning det1-3 and adding correct determiners, we have:  det5_name=det5-distance-det
    det5_stem1_orth=tú
    det5_stem1_pred=_ddet_q_rel
  det6_name=det6-proximate-det
    det6_stem1_orth=čhí
    det6_stem1_pred=_pdet_q_rel

We observed DDET and PDET are also defined as nouns and verbs, so we removed them:
    noun1_stem196_orth=tú
    noun1_stem196_pred=_==ddet_n_rel
    verb2_stem15_orth=čhí
    verb2_stem15_pred=_=pdet_v_rel

We added test cases #19 to #22 to test determiners. #19 is a grammatical sentence with PDET, #20 grammatical with DDET, #21 ungrammatical with PDET and #22 ungrammatical with DDET.

#19 and #20 were parsed successfully after improvements. However, we observed it treated "man PDET cry-ASRT" as "V D N." We observed our choice file had multiple lexical entries for "man" and "cry," they are both in noun and verb categories at the same time. So we cleaned that up (removed _man_v_rel and _cry_n_rel), and changed "noun-det-order=det-noun" to "noun-det." Therefore, #21 and #22 are correctly ruled out because there's no rule for "D V" to form a constituent.


Phenomena #2: PNG

In previous lab, we attempted to improve PNG but there are still some mistakes. We changed numbers from 3-noun-3 to 1-2-3 but didn't add this feature to the lexical entries of _pron_rel_. Therefore, we made added these features in our choice file:

noun122_name=noun122
    noun122_feat1_name=person
    noun122_feat1_value=2nd
    noun122_feat2_name=number
    noun122_feat2_value=sg
  noun122_det=opt
    noun122_stem1_orth=nə́ŋ
    noun122_stem1_pred=_pron_rel_

We observed some pronouns are defined twice so we removed them:
    noun1_stem118_orth=nə́ŋ
    noun1_stem118_pred=_you_n_rel

Additionally, we revised pred of pronouns to be _pron_rel_. Now, our examples #1-11 show correct CONT values for pronouns.

I cry-ASRT
'I cry.'



Phenomena #3: Case

After referencing Chelliah's A grammar of Meithei(2011), in his section about case, there are agentive(=nə), patient(), locative(), ablative(=təgi), genitive(=ki), associative(=kə) and instrumental(=nə) case markers. In the choices file, cases "all", "in" are deleted. "all" is listed as a case, but is not documented or found in item with a valid instance. Therefore, we deleted this case. "in" is an affix found in item, but is not documented as a case.
We think "in" is not a case marker. "ins" stands for instrumental case, which according to Chelliah, is the same as agentive case and shares spelling, therefore we delete it as a separate case.
We added "ass" stands for "associative", which marks indicate that the action has been performed in conjunction with another person
other case markers:
The locative marker may be used to express direction, quantity, or duration.
The ablative marker is used to express direction of movement from a point in space.
The genitive marker indicates possession, so we would come back next week.
The instrumental marker shares spelling with agentive marker, and is argued to be an extension use of agentive case.

There were ambiguities caused by the case since in IGT a subject is marked as =AGN, while -NOM is nominalizer.





3. morphotactic choices improvements:
Morphotactic changes:
1. for case, we put all cases into one position class, since according to Chelliah, case is the last suffix after (gender), (number), (quantifier) in a noun morphology.
Therefore, we renamed noun-pc1 to noun-case position class, and keep lrt1 for abl case, combined noun-pc2, noun-pc4 which have different case lrts into noun-case position class.
other changes:
1. delete noun-pc1_lrt2, the rule has no feature specified, only spelling. By spelling we think this is the genitive case lexical rule type. We will probably come back and add it back.
2. delete noun-pc36, the rule records -nə́bə as a "in" case, but it stands for a suffix meaning IN.ORDER.TO.
3. delete noun-pc27_lrt2 spelling: "-čhin", it used to be in case "in". We deleted it in case setion, and we chose to delete this suffix for now.
4. delete noun-pc5 lrt1, -nə an affix without any feature (should be an adverb suffix)
5. delete noun-pc7 lrt1, -pə no feature specified  (should be nominalizer suffix)

While looking throught lexicon, we found several messy miscategorization of some lexicon type. For example, 'i' in Meithei stands for verb means 'write'. However, it was under a noun type. Similar changes were made with other lexicon, and their type was referenced from Chelliah's A grammar of Meithei(2011).
Lexicon Changes:
1. delete (spelling: "i" pred: _no_gloss_n_rel) in noun type 1
2. moved (spelling: "čaw" pred: _be_big_n_rel) in noun type 1 to verb type2 pred -> _be_big_v_nel
3. moved delete (spelling: "i" pred: _write_n_rel) in noun type 1 to verb type2 pred -> _write_v_rel
4. noun type29: changed thá from noun to verb _release_v_rel(as recorded in IGT) undeer verb type2 (transitive)
