python3 make_item --map orth-seg i-input testsuite.txt item

1. Yes.
2. (TODO?) No extra steps yet.
3.
Before improving the choice file:
  1. 86 items are parsed.
  2. The average number of parses per parsed item is 95.45.
  3. The most ambiguous item (#7560) received 840 parses.
  4.
  Some sources of ambiguity comes from multiple semantic (mrs) possibilities. For instance, the i-input of #730 can either has "_learn_v_rel" or "_toward_v_rel."
  There are also some parsing failures due to "no analysis found corresponding to token." A portion of token is related to person, gender, , such as #50 (NOPI > person-fem) and #90 (NIPA > person-mas).
