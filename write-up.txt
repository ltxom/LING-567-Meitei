1. Documentation of what you changed in your grammar to do MRS refinement. Include IGT to illustrate.

Fix lab 8:

1. asrt-assertive := mood. -> asrt := mood.

2. fixed nom-lex rule to take SENTENCE-MOOD-FLAG + and remove corresponding constraint on mother and daughter:

    nominalizer-lex-rule-super := infl-lex-rule & high-or-mid-nominalization-lex-rule &
      [ DTR nominalizer-rule-dtr ].

    nom-lex-rule := nominalizer-lex-rule-super & [ INFLECTED.SENTENCE-MOOD-FLAG + ].

3. Transfer and trigger rules:
Our mni grammar needs 2 transfer rules: the first is for the locative-pp phrase to translate the sentence like:
    0. ə́y bəzar=tə =ni
       1P park=LOC =COP
       'I am in the park.'
mni, not like English, has a in_p_rel in its gloss, but rather has a locative marker to indicate a formation of PP. Therefore,
our transfer rule is to input "in_p_rel" and output as pred value "_loc_p_rel".
    in-loc-mtr := monotonic_mtr &
    [ INPUT [ RELS < [PRED "_in_p_rel",
               LBL #lbl,
               ARG0 #arg0,
               ARG1 #arg1,
               ARG2 #arg2 ] >,
          HCONS < > ],
      OUTPUT [ RELS < [ PRED "_loc_p_rel",
                 LBL #lbl,
                         ARG0 #arg0,
                 ARG1 #arg1,
                 ARG2 #arg2 ] > ]].
Prior to that, we changed the pred value in locative-pp-phrase to become "_loc_p_rel" to match the rule.
instantiation in acm.mtr:
    in-loc := in-loc-mtr & [].

The second transfer rule is the adj-> stative verb. mni uses stative-verb=COP as the counterpart for adjP non-verbal predicates in English,
so we need a transfer rule to account hungry_a_rel to become be+hungry_v_rel in mni.

the adj->stative transfer rule we added in acm.tdl
    a-stative-v-mtr := monotonic_mtr &
    [ INPUT [ RELS < [PRED "_hungry_a_rel",
               LBL #lbl,
               ARG0 #arg0,
               ARG1 #arg1,
               ARG2 #arg2 ] >,
          HCONS < > ],
      OUTPUT [ RELS < [ PRED "_be+hungry_v_rel",
                 LBL #lbl,
                         ARG0 #arg0,
                 ARG1 #arg1,
                 ARG2 #arg2 ] > ]].

the instantiation in acm.mtr:
    a-stative-v := a-stative-v-mtr & [].

For the semantically empty copula, we need a trigger rule.
Trigger rule for copula =ni:
    ni_gr := generator_rule &
    [ CONTEXT.RELS <! [ PRED "~._p_" ] !>,
      FLAGS.TRIGGER "ni_cop" ].


2. Documentation of what you changed in your grammar to cut back on overgeneration. Include IGT or pointers to the MMT sentences to illustrate.
IGT for possessive marker:
    # 1
    húy=ki garí túm-í
    Dogs=POSS cars sleep-NHYP
    'The dog's cars sleeps'

In lab 8, we discovered our poss =ki doesn't work. We went back to customization system and made poss as specifier instead of modifier by adding two rules head-spec-2 and poss-unary-1:
    head-spec-2 := head-spec-phrase-2.
    poss-unary-1 := poss-unary-phrase-1.

    poss-unary-phrase-1 := poss-unary-phrase &
      [ ARGS < [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.POSSESSOR possessor-1 ] >,
        SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD.SPEC-INIT +,
                           VAL.SPEC.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT.POSSESSUM nonpossessive ] ].

    poss-unary-phrase := basic-unary-phrase &
      [ SYNSEM [ NON-LOCAL #nonloc,
                 LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK #hook,
                         CAT [ HEAD det &
                                    [ POSSESSOR possessor ],
                               VAL [ SPR < >,
                                     COMPS < >,
                                     SUBJ < >,
                                     SPEC < [ LOCAL [ CAT [ VAL.COMPS < >,
                                                            HEAD noun &
                                                                 [ PRON - ] ],
                                                      CONT.HOOK #hook &
                                                                [ INDEX #possessum &
                                                                        [ COG-ST uniq-id ],
                                                                  LTOP #lbl ] ] ] > ] ] ] ],
        C-CONT [ RELS.LIST < arg12-ev-relation &
                             [ PRED "poss_rel",
                               LBL #lbl,

                               ARG2 #possessor ],
                             quant-relation &
                             [ PRED "exist_q_rel",
                               ARG0 #possessum,

                 HCONS.LIST < qeq &
                              [ HARG #harg,
                                LARG #lbl ] >,
                 ICONS.LIST < > ],
        ARGS < [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ VAL [ SPR < >,
                                              COMPS < >,
                                              SUBJ < >,
                                              SPEC < > ],
                                        HEAD +np ],
                                  CONT.HOOK.INDEX #possessor ],
                          NON-LOCAL #nonloc ] ] > ].

    head-spec-phrase-2 := head-final & basic-head-spec-phrase &
      [ NON-HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD.SPEC-INIT +,
                                        VAL.SPEC < [ LOCAL.CAT.POSSESSUM #poss ] > ],
        HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.POSSESSUM #poss ].

head-spec-2 forms "húy=ki garí" as a NP, and poss-unary-1 builds a non-branching D node for bare-NP "húy=ki".
So for #1, the tree is S -> NP(head-spec-2) VP, NP -> D(poss-unary-1) N
However, we found various problems with this structure:
It can parse ungrammatical sentence like:
    #2
    húy=nə  garí túm-í
    dogs=AGN cars sleep-NHYP
    '*The dogs cars sleeps'

The sentence #2 has identical MRS as #1. Because poss-unary-1 can take any Bare-NP to form a D node, we need to find a way to constraint it to only take NP with CASE poss-case.

Therefore, we modified the ARGS in poss-unary-phrase to have HEAD noun & [ CASE poss-case]. It correctly ruled out the case in #2 and only parsed sentence #1. However, when we generate #1 in LKB, we can get ungrammatical sentence like follows:
    #3
    húy  garí túm-í
    dogs cars sleep-NHYP
    '*The dogs cars sleeps'

In #3, because the CASE for húy is underspecified (null case), it can take poss-case and form a NP to satisfy the requirement for poss-unary-1. Therefore, to rule out this situation, we came up with another way: we specified that poss-unary-1 can only take a determiner as its daughter, and changed noun-possessor-pc_lrt1-suffix =ki to be a determiner. We think it might not be the legit way to do since the structure of tree is weird, but this approach can rule out ambiguities and have correct MRS for MT to work.

Here are the TDLs:
We changed possessor-lex-rule-1 to be det POS.
    possessor-lex-rule-1 := head-change-only-lex-rule &
      [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD det &
                              [
                                POSSESSOR possessor-1 ] ].

We modified poss-unary-phrase to take a D node as input:
    poss-unary-phrase := basic-unary-phrase &
      [ SYNSEM [ NON-LOCAL #nonloc,
                 LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK #hook,

Now, the head-spec-2 still cannot form a NP because it inherits from basic-head-spec-phrase-super, which regulates the HEAD of first and second daughter should match. We defined a new basic-head-spec-phrase-custom-super which removed this constraint, and make head-spec-2 inherit from it:
    basic-head-spec-phrase-custom-super := binary-nonloc-phrase & phrasal &
                  binary-headed-phrase &

Now, the case in #2 and #3 are correctly ruled out, and #1 can be parsed correctly.

locative-pp-phrase fix:
After the transfer rule and trigger rule worked, we found out in eng to mni translation for sentence No.16
    húy bəzar=tə =ni
    dog market=LOC =COP
    'The dog is in the market.'
generated 'húy =ni bəzar=tə', which uses head-spec rule to put copula before the PP. We add a constraint of SPEC < > in locative-pp-phrase：

3. For any residual realization ambiguity (multiple outputs for one input), characterize the sources (e.g. free word order).
Our realization ambiguity comes from X phenomena:
    1. Mood markers: verbs can have either ASRT or NHYP for verbal sentences
        Húy túm-í
        dog sleep-NHYP

        Húy túm-e
        dog sleep-ASRT
    2. Number: pronouns have singular, dual, and plural forms
        Ə́y nə́bani tan-í
        1P 2Pdual chase-NHYP

        Ə́y nə́khóy tan-í
        1P 2PPL chase-NHYP

        Ə́y nə́ŋ tan-í
        1P 2PSG chase-NHYP
    3. Different forms of possessive markers:
        Ə́y=ki   húy túm-í
        1P=POSS dog slee-NHYP

        Í-húy túm-í
        1P-dog sleep-NHYP
