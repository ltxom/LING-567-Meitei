1. Yes.
2. No extra steps in modifying the choice file are required to customize and compile it to generate a grammar matrix.
   However, there are some technical steps we processed to compile it. For some reason, .bash_profile in not loaded correctly, so we had to copy it to .bashrc to load tsdb's library. Another step to solving [incr tsdb()] test run record no records issue is the LKB-FOS patch for [incr tsdb].

Before improving the choice file:
  1. 86 items are parsed.
  2. The average number of parses per parsed item is 95.45.
  3. The most ambiguous item (#7560) received 840 parses.
  4.
  The primary source of ambiguity comes from the multi-possibilities of the tree structures. Our choice file contains many lrules so that there are many repeated N/NP nodes in tree constructions.
  Some sources of ambiguity come from multiple semantic (mrs) possibilities. For instance, the i-input of #730 can either has "_learn_v_rel" or "_toward_v_rel."
  5.
  Parsed items with one reading are all sentences constructed by a single verb. Their semantics looks reasonable with same pattern: CONT > RELS > LIST > FIRST > PRED has correct interpretation (e.g., _go_v_rel, _do_v_rel), and REST has a list with certain size filling with null-copy items.

After:
  1. 101 items are parsed.
  2. The average number of parses per parsed item is 19.68.
  3. The most ambiguous item (#1580) received 200 parses.
  4. The primary source of ambiguity is still structural ambiguity, but it is improved since we removed repeated rules in lrule.tdl.
  5. There are some parsed items with only one reading that are constructed by two words (S -> NP VP), and their semantics (e.g., #5440) look right where CONT > RELS > LIST in S contains all the relations of its children.

Phenomena 1: PNG
  Some parsing failures are due to "no analysis found corresponding to token." A portion of token is related to person, gender, and number, such as #50 (NOPI > person-fem), #90 (NIPA > person-mas), #4210 (ə́ykhoy > 1st-pl), #1000 (nə́bani > 2nd-dual).

Phenomena 2: Aspect
This is not very obvious in the testsuite, but looking through the choices file we found that some suffixes are included in the morphology but not specified which phenomena it is. Its counterpart POT potential is listed as one of the aspects so we added NPOT.
#1310 is an example of NPOT existed in the item but not specified in choices.

Phenomena 1: PNG
  We first analyze our choice file to check what is already defined for Meitei's PNG features. We found its person section has 3-non-3, which is the same as English. However, according to Chelliah's A grammar of Meithei, it distinguishes pronouns as the first, second, and third person, despite there being no syntactic agreements between pronouns and other POS. Additionally, pronouns are classified by three types of numbers, single(sg), plural(pl), and dual. For genders, Chelliah indicates that "nouns are not marked for grammatical gender. Semantic gender may be indicated for animate beings by -pi 'female' and -pa 'male.'"
  Therefore, our improvements focus on defining lexical entries for missing pronouns and adding three types of numbers (sg, pl, dual) to assign them to different pronouns.
  Here are some examples to test our improvements in Meitei PNG:

Source: {a: 79, b: 218, author}
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {pn}
ə́y kə́pe
ə́y kə́p-e
I cry-ASRT
'I cry.'

Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {pn}
nə́ŋ kə́pe
nə́ŋ kə́p-e
You cry-ASRT
'You cry.'

  Our testsuites.txt contains all 9 pronouns [PER 1st/2nd/3rd NUM sg/pl/dual] test cases in a similar structure as above: [PRONOUN cry-ASRT]. In our choice file, we added the section=number with sg, pl, dual. We revised person=3-noun-3 to 1-2-3. The reset improvements involve lexical entries of pronouns. We removed duplicated noun113 (he/she, identical with noun111), revised noun111-112 with person&number features, and added noun 114-121. Therefore, noun111-121 (without 113) contains the combination of 1st, 2nd, 3rd person pronouns with numbers of sg, pl, dual. The pronouns are correctly parsed and marked as the children of NP. Despite ambiguities coming from other parts of the grammar, the reading for [NUM pl/dual] is only 3, for [PER 1st/2nd NUM sg] is 6, and for [PER 3rd NUM sg] is 12. We also confirmed every item contains correct PNG information in its INDEX. The following is an ungrammatical example that test if our improvements overcover the negative items:

Source: {a: 79, b: 218, author}
Vetted: t
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {pn}
ə́ynə́ŋ kə́pe
ə́y-nə́ŋ kə́p-e
I-you cry-ASRT
'*I-you cry.'

Since nə́ŋ is a pronoun lexical entry but not an affix, the parser correctly eliminates these ungrammatical cases.


Phenomena 2: Aspect
In the choices file, we found case is already taken care of, and Meithei does not have agreement according to Chelliah. Therefore, the improvement naturally falls on to tam. Mehtei does not have tense, but do have several aspect markers.
As mentioned above, NPOT is present in the test suite, but not included in the choices. potential and non-potential is an indicator of future. They are both verb suffixes. For potential the suffix is -kə(already documented) and for non-potential is -loy.
Some examples we test out tweak are as following:

Source: {a: 231, b: 218, author}
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
ə́y paloy
ə́y pa-loy

mə́bani loyčá
mə́bani loy-čá
they_dual NPOT-eat
'*They two will not eat'

To model this Aspect, I added a NPOT aspect that takes same verb inputs as POT aspect.
Our test suite contains both POT and NPOT examples, for they should be same to POT which already included in the choices. The ungrammatical examples successfully eliminates it attaching to pronouns or being a prefix of a verb.

  One thing we noticed is that in the starter grammar, many affixes are listed in the morphology section, but not many are put under specific phenomena. For example, Meithei has many mood markers but are not specified in the mood section. In addition, the possession phenomena is not specified at all for starter grammar and we have found genitive marker when skimming through Chelliah's literature. In addition to morphology, we haven't really looked at word order that seems to cause many
  ambituities for sentences.

7. As we went over in Thursday's lecture, the rules in lrules.tdl are repetitive as we are not sure how we should fix them in the originated files, for now commenting them out is sufficient. The 2000 unpacking problem was caused by the repetitive rules. 
Some sentences in the item are extremely long that fails to parse. The number of these sentences are #158(parsable) and #729.
