  	test suite: 48 parses;

1.4.
  Before improvements:
    For 3 parsed items in our test suite, the primary source of ambiguity comes from duplicated definitions of PC/lexicon for nouns and verbs. For example, 
	{
	íyúmtə mí ləyí
	í-yúm=tə mí ləy-í
	1P-house=LOC man be-NHYP
	'(A) man live in my house.'
	}
    The original grammar parses it with more than 80 readings since (1) bare noun "mí" has a noun and verb POS definitions at the same time, (2) there are inaccurate definitions for affix "í" in PCs. 
  After improvements:
    The number of readings is significantly reduced after lab4 (from 95.45 to 8.33 on average). Now the primary source of ambiguity comes from the rules for argument optionality.
    

Phenomena 1: Nominalization
    The nominalizer suffix is "-pə".
    Verbs can be nominalized to function as relative adjectives and nominal complements. Last lab, we put in a test sentence
    ə́y čaw-pə.
    I big-NOM.
    'I am big'
    which is just to examine the nominalization suffix is attached to the verb, but we came up with a poor example. As mentioned above, The verb can be nominalized to be adjectives, which does not equal to it can be used the same as a non-verbal predicate.
    The example should be:

    ə́-čaw-pə mí kə́p-e.
    ATT-big-NOM man cry-ASRT.
    '(A) big man cries.'

    The nominalization in subordinate clauses follows the rule below. The nominalization is always suffixed to the verb, not higher, it does not change the constituent to a nominal one.
    S_nom -> (NP*) V_nom

    code snippets
    {
    section=nominalclause
      ns1_name=nominalizer

    The ungrammatical test is to examine the nominalizer to be a suffix.

    ATT-NOM-tall man ATT-DDET water-bath-prog
    "*The tall man is swimming"

Phenomena 2: Clausal Complement
    The clausal complement in Methei is: S -> S'V according to Chelliah. The object complement is placed in the same position as a regular noun phrase.
    The structure for complement clause is: S' -> S_nom (COMP). As stated, the complementizer is optional. Under a few circumstances the verb is not inflected by nominalization.
    Complementizers can either be solely "-pə" the nominalizer, or a sequence of determiner+nominalizer, abrrieviated as -DCOMP, spelled as "-pəsi/-pədu".

    code snippets
    {
    section=clausal-comp
      comps1_clause-pos-same=on
      comps1_ques=prop
      comps1_comp-pos-after=on
      comps1_comp=opt
        comps1_stem1_orth=-pədu
        comps1_stem2_orth=-pəsi
    }

    Examples in testsuite：
    This is a special case indicating that the complementizer is optional, for verbs of saying they don't have NOM suffixes.

    other changes to choices in Morphology an Lexicon:
    1. delete lexical rule instance -pə in verb-pc68_lrt1. add new position class for -pə as a nominalizer to V syntactically.
    2. add lexicon "win"
    verb37_stem3_orth=thoy
    verb37_stem3_pred=_win_v_rel

Phenomena 3: Adnominal possession
    According to Chelliah's A grammar of Meithei (2011), the possessions are formed by the suffixation of the possessor marker (=ki) on the possessor noun. By observing our IGT provided by the linguist, we found the possessor is like a modifier of the possessum since the possessum can take a determiner irrespective of whether or not the possessor appears, as shown in the following example:
    {
    Tomba-ki   e-ni-su-pe        me-ca    nu-pi-tu pheje-i
    Tomba-POSS ATT-two-ALSO-NOM  nm-small person-FEM-DDET beauty-NHYP
    '(The) Tomba's second daughter is beautiful.'
    }

    Additionally, there is no agreement between possessor and possessum. Here are changes in our choice file:
    {
    section=adnom-poss
      poss-strat1_order=head-final
      poss-strat1_mod-spec=mod
      poss-strat1_mark-loc=possessor
      poss-strat1_possessor-type=affix
      poss-strat1_possessor-affix-agr=non-agree

      noun-pc45_inputs=noun1, noun2, noun61, noun79, noun111, noun112, noun115, noun116, noun117, noun118, noun119, noun120, noun122
        noun-pc45_lrt1_name=noun-possessor-pc_lrt1
          noun-pc45_lrt1_feat1_name=poss-strat1
          noun-pc45_lrt1_feat1_value=possessor
          noun-pc45_lrt1_feat1_head=itself
          noun-pc45_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
          noun-pc45_lrt1_lri1_orth==ki
    }
    We tested the following grammatical  sentences in our testsuites.txt #14-16:
    {
    Source: {a: 78&126, author}
    Vetted: t
    Judgment: g
    Phenomena: {poss, case, pn}
    ə́y/nə́ŋ/máki yúmtə mí ləyí
    ə́y/nə́ŋ/má=ki yúm=tə mí ləy-í
    1P/2P/3P=POSS house=LOC man be-NHYP
    '(A) man live in my/your/his_her house.'
    }
    It shows a correct N node named NOUN-POSSESSOR-PC_LRT1-SUFFIX above each possessive noun, and the semantic information is correctly displayed (with poss_rel, pron_rel).

    In addition, we also tested some ungrammatical  examples by putting the possessive markers in wrong places as following data:
    {
    Source: {a: 78&126, author}
    Vetted: t
    Judgment: u
    Phenomena: {poss, case, pn}
    kiə́y/nə́ŋ/má yúmtə mí ləyí
    ki=ə́y/nə́ŋ/má yúm=tə mí ləy-í
    POSS=1P/2P/3P house=LOC man be-NHYP
    '*(A) man live in my/your/his_her house.'
    }
    Our grammar correctly ruled out these examples since we defined poss-strat1_order as "head-final."

Phenomena 4: Determiners
    After reading your feedback from lab3, we investigated determiners more by checking IGT provided by the linguist. We realized determiners in Meitei are not words but suffixes. Therefore, we redid our work on determiners in lab3 by removing the following lines:
    {
      det5_name=det5-distance-det
        det5_stem1_orth=tú
        det5_stem1_pred=_ddet_q_rel
      det6_name=det6-proximate-det
        det6_stem1_orth=čhí
        det6_stem1_pred=_pdet_q_rel
      det-pc1_name=det-pc1
      det-pc1_order=suffix
      det-pc1_inputs=det5, det6
    }

    Then, we defined noun-determiner-pc to account for determiner suffixes:
    {
      noun-pc44_name=noun-determiner-pc
      noun-pc44_order=suffix
      noun-pc44_inputs=noun1, noun2, noun61, noun79
        noun-pc44_lrt1_name=noun-determiner-pc-distance_lrt
          noun-pc44_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
          noun-pc44_lrt1_lri1_orth=-tú
        noun-pc44_lrt2_name=noun-determiner-pc-proximate_lrt
          noun-pc44_lrt2_lri1_inflecting=yes
          noun-pc44_lrt2_lri1_orth=-čhí
    }

    Thus, determiners can only appear as suffixes but not words. We test it to be true with the following examples:
    {
    Source: {a: 249, author}
    Vetted: t
    Judgment: g
    Phenomena: {det}
    míčhí kə́pe
    mí-čhí kə́p-e
    man-PDET cry-ASRT
    'The (proximate) man cries.'

    Source: {a: 249, author}
    Vetted: t
    Judgment: u
    Phenomena: {det}
    čhí kə́pe
    -čhí kə́p-e
    -PDET cry-ASRT
    '*The (proximate) cries.'
    }
    Additionally, we observed the order of determiner suffixes and case markers and found determiner suffixes always appear case markers. To ensure that, we set the input of our noun-pc1(case-marker) to be noun-pc44(determiner-suffix). We tested it to be correct with the following examples:
    {
    #9-10
    Source: {a: 126, author}
    Vetted: t
    Judgment: u
    Phenomena: {det, c}
    má kə́ytəgitú/čhí hənləmí
    má kə́y=təgi-tú/čhí hən-ləm-í
    he granary=ABL-DDET/PDET return-EVD-HYNP
    '*He returned from the (distal) granary.'
    }
4. Beyond possessive markers attached as suffixes to possessors, Meitei also has possessive pronominal prefixes (í-/nə́-/mə́-). We included these examples in our testsuites:
    {
    # 11-13
    Source: {a: 78&126, author}
    Vetted: t
    Judgment: g
    Phenomena: {poss, case, pn}
    í/nə́/məyúmtə mí ləyí
    í/nə́/mə-yúm=tə mí ləy-í
    1P/2P/3P-house=LOC man be-NHYP
    '(A) man live in my house.'
    }
    We first attempted to define the following poss-strat and noun-pc:
    {
      poss-strat1_possessum-type=affix
      poss-strat1_possessum-affix-agr=non-agree

      noun-pc46_order=prefix
      noun-pc46_inputs=noun1, noun2, noun61, noun79
        noun-pc46_lrt1_name=noun-possessum-pc_lrt1
          noun-pc46_lrt1_feat1_name=poss-strat1
          noun-pc46_lrt1_feat1_value=possessum
          noun-pc46_lrt1_feat1_head=itself
          noun-pc46_lrt1_feat2_name=person
          noun-pc46_lrt1_feat2_value=1st
          noun-pc46_lrt1_feat2_head=possessum
          noun-pc46_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
          noun-pc46_lrt1_lri1_orth=í-
          noun-pc46_lrt2_feat1_name=poss-strat1
          noun-pc46_lrt2_feat1_value=possessum
          noun-pc46_lrt2_feat1_head=itself
          noun-pc46_lrt2_feat2_name=person
          noun-pc46_lrt2_feat2_value=2nd
          noun-pc46_lrt2_feat2_head=possessum
          noun-pc46_lrt2_lri1_inflecting=yes
          noun-pc46_lrt2_lri1_orth=nə́-
          noun-pc46_lrt3_feat1_name=poss-strat1
          noun-pc46_lrt3_feat1_value=possessum
          noun-pc46_lrt3_feat1_head=itself
          noun-pc46_lrt3_feat2_name=person
          noun-pc46_lrt3_feat2_value=3rd
          noun-pc46_lrt3_feat2_head=possessum
          noun-pc46_lrt3_lri1_inflecting=yes
          noun-pc46_lrt3_lri1_orth=mə́-
    }
    It seems the resulting grammar cannot parse possessive pronominal prefixes. You suggested, "define as class of possessive pronouns for this case and then make a PC with poss-pron1, rather than poss-strat1." We attempted to define a new feature and replace poss-pron1 with it:
    {
      feature1_name=poss-pron1
      feature1_type=head
      feature1_cat=noun
      feature1_new=yes
        feature1_value1_name=possessive
          feature1_value1_supertype1_name=poss-pron1
        feature1_value2_name=nonpossessive
          feature1_value2_supertype1_name=poss-pron1

      noun-pc46_lrt1_feat1_name=poss-pron1
      noun-pc46_lrt1_feat1_value=possessive
      noun-pc46_lrt1_feat1_head=itself
      noun-pc46_lrt1_feat2_name=person
      noun-pc46_lrt1_feat2_value=1st
      noun-pc46_lrt1_feat2_head=possessum
      noun-pc46_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
      noun-pc46_lrt1_lri1_orth=í-
      ......
    }
    However, the result grammar matrix cannot be loaded by LKB with following errors:
    {
        Error in NOUN-PC46_LRT1-LEX-RULE:
          Type of fs NULL at path (SYNSEM LOCAL CONT RELS APPEND REST FIRST LIST) is incompatible with features (FIRST REST) which have maximal type CONS
        Error in NOUN-PC46_LRT2-LEX-RULE:
          Type of fs NULL at path (SYNSEM LOCAL CONT RELS APPEND REST FIRST LIST) is incompatible with features (FIRST REST) which have maximal type CONS
        Error in NOUN-PC46_LRT3-LEX-RULE:

          of NULL at path (SYNSEM LOCAL CONT RELS APPEND REST FIRST LIST) is incompatible with features (FIRST REST) which have maximal type CONS
    }

    We couldn't resolve this problem yet, but we hope to make it next time. For now, we just defined these possessive pronominal prefixes in noun-pc38.

5. Except the above problem, we didn't find any other problems yet.
