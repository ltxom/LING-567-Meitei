When translating #15, The dogs are hungry, from English to Meitei, we got
    NOTE: EP '"_hungry_a_rel"' is unknown in the semantic index
    WARNING: EP '"_hungry_a_rel"' is not covered
This is because "hungry" in Meitei functions as a stative verb mentioned above, and its MRS is "_be+hungry_v_rel," which indicates that we need a transfer rule to account for this.

When translating #16, The dogs are in the park, we got 0 results without any error messages. We attempted to translate this sentence from Meitei to English, and it gave correct results. When we translate it from mni to mni, we still got 0 results. However, we can get one identical sentence from generating from the parse of it in the LKB. We posted it on Canvas and were waiting to find a solution to it.
We compared their MRS and found they are about identical (differences are marked between ***):
ENG:

We wonder the problem comes from COG-ST or PNG.NUM sections in our semi.vpm, but we don't find any issues:
    COG-ST : COG-ST
      type-id <> type-id
      uniq-id <> uniq-id
      familiar <> familiar
      activated <> activated
      in-foc <> in-foc
      activ+fam <> activ+fam
      uniq+fam <> uniq+fam
      activ-or-more <> activ-or-more
      uniq-or-less <> uniq-or-less
      uniq+fam+act <> uniq+fam+act
      fam-or-more <> fam-or-more
      fam-or-less <> fam-or-less
      uniq-or-more <> uniq-or-more
      activ-or-less <> activ-or-less
      * <> *


    PNG.PER : PER
      3rd <> third
      2nd <> second
      1st <> first
      * <> *

    PNG.NUM : NUM
      dual <> dual
      pl <> pl
      sg <> sg
      * <> *

It can translate #17, The dogs are the cats, from English to Meitei and give 1 correct result:
    Húy hə́wdóŋ =ni


4. We haven't worked on wh questions and couldn't find wh questions of non-verbal predicates examples yet since our literature doesn't have a specific section to discuss this phenomenon. We would like to consult Prof. Shobhana Chelliah to learn more about it.

What NEW sources of ambiguity can you identify?
  The source of ambiguity comes from lexical ambiguity of má, which means "mother" or "he or she." This ambiguity should be legit.
